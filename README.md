![dataset-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add98748-5842-495b-ba99-e59474445cca)

## 📊 Dataset Source

- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Heart Attack Dataset – Tarik A. Rashid](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmohammadinia/heart-attack-dataset-tarik-a-rashid)
- This dataset contains 15+ medical attributes that can be used to predict the probability of a heart attack.

##  Project Goals

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Identify the most influential features in heart attack prediction


## ⚙️ Features in Dataset

- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise-induced angina
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0–3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- `output`: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Model Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
